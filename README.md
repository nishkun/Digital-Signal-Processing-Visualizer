# Signal Processing Visualizer (SPV) üìä

An interactive, web-based Digital Signal Processing (DSP) tool built for students, educators, and engineers. This application allows users to upload or generate signals and interactively explore time-domain and frequency-domain representations. Perform real-time analysis, apply filters, compute convolutions, and visualize spectrograms with a clean and intuitive interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Visualizations**: Pan, zoom, and inspect signals in both the time and frequency domains using Plotly.js.
* **Comprehensive DSP Toolkit**: Compute FFTs, convolve signals, and generate spectrograms using a powerful Python backend with SciPy and NumPy.
* **Real-Time Analysis**: Capture live audio from your microphone and see the frequency spectrum update in real-time.
* **File Handling**: Upload signals in CSV format, specify sample rates, and export processed signals back to your computer.
* **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with a React/TypeScript frontend, a Node.js/Express API gateway, and a Python/FastAPI microservice for DSP tasks.
* **Production Ready**: The entire application is containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy deployment and scalability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v20.x or higher)
* Python (v3.11 or higher)
* Docker & Docker Compose

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to run the entire application.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project root:
    ```bash
    cd spv
    ```
3.  Build and run the containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

This project uses a microservice architecture to separate concerns:

* **React Frontend**: Handles all UI rendering and user interaction.
* **Express API**: Acts as a gateway, routing requests from the frontend to the appropriate backend service.
* **FastAPI DSP Service**: A dedicated Python service for performing numerically intensive DSP calculations.
